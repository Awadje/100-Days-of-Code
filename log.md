# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished two days of 30 days of Javascript. Day 1 I made drumkit where I learned about key events and playing audio. Day 2 I made a JS and CSS Clock where I learned about css animations and Javascript time functions

**Thoughts:** I really like to practice my vanilla Javascript skills and it's awesome to discover the built in functions.

### Day 2: July 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on integration tests for my rails blog learned about assert_select to find HTML classes and using sessions in the controller test to test admin functionality. Created a very basic express, mongo, nodeJS API

**Thoughts:** It was new working with rails test instead of Rspec and was great to experiment with it. Did a small API with Express and Mongo amazed by how little actual code was required

### Day 3: July 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played around with  Javascript basics: Variables, Operators, Conditionals, Functions, Objects, Arrays and ES6. Easygoing on Sunday

**Thoughts:** It was good to refresh these basic fundamentals, it's all about repetition.
