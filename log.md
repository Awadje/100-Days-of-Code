# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished two days of 30 days of Javascript. Day 1 I made drumkit where I learned about key events and playing audio. Day 2 I made a JS and CSS Clock where I learned about css animations and Javascript time functions

**Thoughts:** I really like to practice my vanilla Javascript skills and it's awesome to discover the built in functions.
